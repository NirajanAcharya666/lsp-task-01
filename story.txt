"Is it real?" 
It's the unforeseen story of a boy who lives in London. He 
wakes up daily, goes to college, comes home, does assignments, and helps 
parents at work. He has very few friends, which obviously clarifies that he 
is an introvert. His parents used to work on a decent salary basis, and they 
provided him with a dreamful childhood. His parents have always granted him 
whatever he has asked for; he has never heard any no's or but's. One day in 
an airless summer, something happened that changed his life forever. He was walking on the streets of London and he met a beggar.
The beggar asked him to give a few bucks. Rightfully so, the boy gave him 50 bucks immediately. Then he walked away.
To his utter surprise, the beggar also followed him all along. 
Once their eyes met, the man turned his back around and sprinted in the opposite direction, out of sight. The boy’s mind was too foggy to process what just happened and he just went his way.
As he strolled through the streets of the English capital, the lad did feel again as if he was being watched, or even worse – followed by someone, or something. 
He tried to shrug it off by playing the newly released album by his favorite band, Brockhampton and trying to decipher the lyrics. 
As he entered a disturbingly empty underground crossing tunnel, he felt shivers throughout his body. He slowly looked behind him and noticed an entity, something that resembled a human but at the same time its features were anything but humanlike.
In a split second, he dropped to the ground, unable to move or speak – deadbeat. It felt surreal, making him question his sanity and existence. Was this the end?
The boy was terrified, unable to move as the strange figure hovered over him in the dim tunnel. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the figure vanished. Finally he was able to move his body; He ran outside of the tunnel.
He was still feeling watched and paranoid. When he finally reached home and tried to explain to his parents, there was a knock at the door, he freaked out of fear.
